# Fighting Game Weapons

Random notes about a hopeful weapon-pack for my fighting game.

* Hands:
  * Any: left, or right.
  * Both: for two-handed weapons.
  * Can wear different weapons in each hand. (Combine almost anything!)
* Firearms:
  * Bullets are not as lethal in combat. :P
* Tertiary Weapons:
  * Small, throwable weapons.
  * Can have two weapons plus a tertiary one.
  * Some weapon types do not allow tertiary weapons.
