# Fighting Game Weapons

Random notes about a hopeful weapon-pack for my fighting game.

* Hands:
  * "Any": left, or right.
  * "Both": for two-handed weapons.
  * Can wear different weapons in each hand. (Combine almost anything!)
* Defense:
  * "Shield Hitpoints" mechanic isn't available to weapon wielders.
  * Defense is based on left-handed or two-handed weapon being used.
  * Each weapon type has a defense level.
  * Due to the higher damage potential with weapons, even the most defensive weapon will have weaker protection compared to bare-handed fighters using "Shield Hitpoints".
* Firearms:
  * Bullets are not as lethal in combat. :P
* Tertiary Weapons:
  * Small, throwable weapons.
  * Can have two weapons plus a tertiary one.
  * Some weapon types do not allow tertiary weapons.
