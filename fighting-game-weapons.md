# Fighting Game Weapons

Random notes about a hopeful weapon-pack for my fighting game.

* Left and right hands can hold one weapon each, and they don't need to be the same type.
  * Combine almost anything: Gladius + Shield, Dual Daggers, etc.
* Weapon users do not have "Shield" points (will be replaced by something else).
  * This allows weapon users to fight bare handed fighters on a more equal footing.
* Hands:
  * Any: left, or right.
  * Both: for two-handed weapons.
* Firearms:
  * Bullets are not as lethal. :)
